# Where I started

I started by looking at the Scryfall R package, which is kind of like a built in API.

-`scryr`: uses function `scry_cards()` to find magic cards that fit the search
```{r}
#| message: false
library(scryr)
```
## Problems
Unfortunately, the package turned out to be not really what I was looking for. Not only was the syntax for searching very unique and complex but it took too long to find the amount of cards that I wanted.

# Next Steps

Then, I looked at the MTGJSON data, which both has an API and downloadable files of all
MTG cards.

```{r}
#| include: false
library(tidyverse)
```
